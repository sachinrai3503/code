"""
A stable tower of height n is a tower consisting of exactly n tiles of unit height
 stacked vertically in such a way, that no bigger tile is placed on a smaller tile.

We have an infinite number of tiles of sizes 1, 2, â€¦, m. The task is to calculate 
 the number of the different stable towers of height n that can be built from these
 tiles, with a restriction that you can use at most k tiles of each size in the tower.

 Note: Two towers of height n are different if and only if there exists a 
       height h (1 <= h <= n), such that the towers have tiles of different sizes at height h.

Examples: 
Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 1.
Output : 1
Possible sequences: { 1, 2, 3}. 
Hence answer is 1.

Input : n = 3, m = 3, k = 2.
Output : 7
{1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3}, {1, 2, 2},
{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 3}, {2, 2, 3}, 
{2, 3, 3}.
